    <h1>Jesus cast out an unclean spirit (Mark 1:23-28).</h1>
    <p>While Jesus was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum, a dramatic and unexpected event occurred. As He was preaching, a man possessed by an unclean spirit (a demon) suddenly interrupted. The man cried out in a loud voice, “What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”

        The demon inside the man recognized Jesus as the Holy One of God, but it also feared His power. The demon knew that its time was limited, and it was afraid of being cast out. The unclean spirit’s words showed its knowledge of Jesus' true identity, though its intentions were evil.
        
        In response to the demon’s cry, Jesus did not engage in a conversation or debate. Instead, He commanded the spirit in a firm voice: “Be quiet! Come out of him!” Jesus’ authority was unmistakable. He spoke directly to the demon, and it immediately obeyed.
        
        The unclean spirit, with a violent convulsion, threw the man to the ground before coming out of him. The people in the synagogue were astonished. They had never witnessed anything like this before. They were amazed and said to each other, “What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits, and they obey Him.”
        
        News of this miracle spread quickly throughout the region, and people were amazed at Jesus’ power and authority. The incident demonstrated not only His divine authority to cast out demons but also His authority in teaching and healing.</p>
