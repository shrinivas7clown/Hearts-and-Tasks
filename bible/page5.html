    <h1>Jesus cured Peter's mother-in-law of a fever (Mark 1:30-31).</h1>
    <p>One day, after Jesus had taught in the synagogue and cast out an evil spirit, He went with His disciples to the home of Peter and his brother Andrew. When they arrived, they found that Peter's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a high fever. The situation was serious because in ancient times, a fever could be a sign of a life-threatening illness, and medical knowledge was limited.

        The disciples immediately told Jesus about her condition. Without hesitation, Jesus went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. As He did, the fever left her, and she was completely healed. Not only was the fever gone, but she was also restored to full health and strength.
        
        In an instant, Peter's mother-in-law was able to get up and serve them, demonstrating her complete recovery. This act of kindness not only revealed Jesus' compassion but also His divine power over sickness and disease. The healing was not just physical but also a spiritual sign of His authority and care for individuals, showing that His mission was to restore people in every way.</p>
