    <h1>2. Jesus cured the nobleman's son (John 4:46-47).</h1>
    <p>After Jesus left Judea, He returned to Galilee. While He was in the town of Cana, where He had previously turned water into wine, a nobleman (a royal official) came to Him from Capernaum, about 20 miles away. This nobleman had a son who was very ill, nearing death. The father, desperate and full of hope, had heard about the miracles Jesus had performed, including His turning water into wine, and believed that Jesus could heal his son.

        The nobleman begged Jesus to come to Capernaum and heal his son. He said, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”
        
        Jesus, seeing the man’s faith and urgency, responded with a statement that might have seemed strange at first: “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.” However, His words were not meant to rebuke the man but to address the general crowd’s need for visible miracles to believe in Him. Despite this, Jesus assured the nobleman, “Go, your son will live.”
        
        The nobleman took Jesus at His word. Trusting Jesus’ word and not doubting, he began his journey back home. As he was on his way, his servants met him and informed him that his son was alive and recovering. They explained that the fever had left him at the exact time that Jesus had spoken the words, "Your son will live."
        
        The nobleman then realized that this was the moment when Jesus had declared his son's healing. In that moment, his faith in Jesus deepened. He and his entire household believed in Jesus, making it not just a healing, but a spiritual transformation for the nobleman and his family.</p>
