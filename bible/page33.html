    <h1>Jesus rose from the dead (Luke 24:5-8).</h1>
    <p>After the crucifixion of Jesus, His disciples and followers were devastated. They believed that Jesus, their teacher and Messiah, had been defeated by death. They placed His body in a tomb and sealed it, thinking that the story was over. But the resurrection proved otherwise.

        On the third day, a group of women, including Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, went to the tomb early in the morning with spices to anoint Jesus’ body, as was customary. When they arrived at the tomb, they found that the stone covering the entrance had been rolled away. The tomb was empty.
        
        Suddenly, they were confronted by two men in gleaming clothes—angels—who appeared to them and asked, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here; He has risen!” The angels reminded the women that Jesus had previously told them that He would rise from the dead on the third day. The angels said, “Remember how He told you, while He was still with you in Galilee: ‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified, and on the third day be raised again.’”
        
        The women then remembered Jesus' words and hurried to share the good news with the disciples.</p>
