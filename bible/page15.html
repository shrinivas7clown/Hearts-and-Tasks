    <h1>Jesus loosened the tongue of a man who could not speak (Matthew 9:32-33).</h1>
    <p>As Jesus was traveling and teaching, a man who had been mute due to a demon possession was brought to Him. This man was unable to speak because of the demon that controlled him. His inability to speak was likely causing great distress, as speech is a basic means of communication and self-expression.

        The people who brought him recognized Jesus' healing power and hoped that He could heal the man. Jesus, full of compassion, did not hesitate to act.
        
        Without any elaborate rituals, Jesus simply cast out the demon from the man. Immediately, the man who had been mute began to speak. His speech was restored, and the crowd was amazed. They marveled at what they had witnessed, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”
        
        However, the Pharisees—religious leaders who opposed Jesus—responded with skepticism and criticism. They accused Jesus of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons. In their eyes, Jesus was not a divine figure but rather someone working through dark powers. This accusation against Jesus' divine power would later become a point of contention as His ministry continued.</p>
